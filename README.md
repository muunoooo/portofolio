# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Muhammad Naufal

**Fullstack Developer based in Indonesia**

I'm a full-stack web developer who made a career transition from geological engineering into the tech industry. Since starting my coding journey in 2024, I've focused on building responsive, user-friendly web applications using modern technologies like:

- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Supabase**
- **Node.js**

With experience in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy crafting clean, efficient, and scalable solutions â€” whether it's designing a dynamic landing page, building a CMS dashboard, or integrating APIs.

My background in engineering has equipped me with strong problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork skills, which I now apply in building web-based products.
